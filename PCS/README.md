# Philanthropy Classification System

(from Candid's website: https://taxonomy.candid.org/)

The Philanthropy Classification System (PCS) is Candid’s (formerly Foundation Center and GuideStar) taxonomy, describing the work of grantmakers, recipient organizations and the philanthropic transactions between those entities. Candid’s Classification System is based on the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) and has been expanded over the last three decades to include the emerging work we have evidenced while capturing and indexing the work of the sector on a global scale.

Candid’s Grants Classification System (GCS) was based on the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) and was expanded over the last three decades to include the emerging work we evidenced while capturing and indexing the work of the sector on a global scale. The GCS served as the basis for much of Candid’s work for the last 30 years. In 2012, in order to better meet the needs of the philanthropic sector, Candid began an extensive review of the GCS, reexamining both the terms included in the taxonomy and the overall structure. The goal was not to create yet another standard, but to better capture the work being done in the social sector around the globe and to develop a tool that would enable the sector to classify and organize their own work. The end product was the Philanthropy Classification System (PCS), which was released in 2015.

The facets of the PCS illuminate the work and answer the following questions about philanthropy:

* Who? = Population Served
* What? = Subject and Organization Type
* How? = Support Strategy and Transaction Type

Candid also formerly maintained a taxonomy for geographic area served known as GeoTree. While Candid continues to code organizations and transactions for geographic area served, we no longer use the GeoTree taxonomy. Instead, Candid relies on GeoNames as its gazetteer of place names and identifiers. To help ensure the consistency of geographic data, we only use a subset of GeoNames places. If your organization is interested in providing data on geographic area served using GeoNames, or has questions about how to transition from GeoTree to GeoNames, please reach out to taxonomy@candid.org for more guidance.
