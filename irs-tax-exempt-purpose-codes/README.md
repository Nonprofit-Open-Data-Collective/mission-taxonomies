## IRS Tax-Exempt Purpose Codes  

When applying for tax exempt status from the IRS, nonprofit founders report organizational purpose codes on the 1023 form. These codes differ from the NTEE taxonomies in that each code is binary (yes/no), and they are NOT mutually exclusive, so a nonprofit mission can fulfill one or several of these purposes. Instructions for completing IRS 1023-EZ mission codes pp 6-7 [FORM](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1023ez.pdf).

The IRS has started releasing some of the meta-data for 1023-EZ forms, which allows us to incorporate the codes into the training dataset. 

* Charitable Purpose [yes/no]
* Religious Purpose [yes/no]

* Scientific Purpose [yes/no]
