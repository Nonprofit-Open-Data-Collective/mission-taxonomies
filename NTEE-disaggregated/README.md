# National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities


## Overview 

From: https://nccs.urban.org/project/national-taxonomy-exempt-entities-ntee-codes

The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) system is used by the IRS and NCCS to classify nonprofit organizations. It is also used by the Foundation Center to classify both grants and grant recipients (typically nonprofits or governments).  NCCS and the IRS use the NTEE-CC system, described below, while the Foundation Center uses a slightly different version with more codes, as well as "population/beneficiary" codes to indicate the type of population served and "auspice" codes to indicate religious or governmental affiliation.


### Structure of the NTEE-CC

**Major Groups:**

* I. Arts, Culture, and Humanities - A
* II. Education - B
* III. Environment and Animals - C, D
* IV. Health - E, F, G, H
* V. Human Services - I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P
* VI. International, Foreign Affairs - Q
* VII. Public, Societal Benefit - R, S, T, U, V, W
* VIII. Religion Related - X
* IX. Mutual/Membership Benefit - Y
* X. Unknown, Unclassified - Z

**Common Codes:** 

Common codes represent activities of organizations, such as research, fundraising, and technical assistance, which are common to all major groups. The seven common codes used are:

* 01 Alliance/Advocacy Organizations  
* 02 Management and Technical Assistance  
* 03 Professional Societies/Associations  
* 05 Research Institutes and/or Public Policy Analysis 
* 11 Monetary Support - Single Organization  
* 12 Monetary Support - Multiple Organizations  
* 19 Nonmonetary Support Not Elsewhere Classified (N.E.C.)
