# National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities


## Overview 

A short history of the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) system. 

## Codes

A table of the NTEE codes is available at the National Center for Charitable Statistics: 

https://nccs.urban.org/publication/irs-activity-codes

For a more friendly format, [dhenderson has created a JSON version](https://github.com/dhenderson/ntee): 

[ntee.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/mission-taxonomies/main/NTEE/ntee.json)

Or you can download the table as a CSV:

[ntee.csv](https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/mission-taxonomies/tree/main/NTEE)


## New NTEE Format

Crosswalk table that includes high-level codes (major groups, minor groups) and the new disaggregated codes.
