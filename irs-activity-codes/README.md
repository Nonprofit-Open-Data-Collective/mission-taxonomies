## ACTIVITY CODES

An organization formerly listed up to three activity codes on application Forms 1023 and 1024. These are codes which
reflect an organization's purposes, activities, operations, or type. From one to three activity codes may be in this field.

Note: activity codes became obsolete with the adoption of the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entity (NTEE) coding system
in January 1995. However, organizations determined to be exempt prior to that date will reflect the activity codes
previously assigned. 

The final column in the table below represents the mapping of obsolete activity codes to current NTEE codes.
